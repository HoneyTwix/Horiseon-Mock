# Code Refactor Starter Code
Horiseon Mock-Up

Purpose:

This project is a refractor of a pre-existing code which was used to make a website called Horiseon.
The website details how a company can grow their online prescense in various of ways.

Goal:

The code is refractored so that it can be more accessible to its users. Nowadays, websites need to be more inclusive to people who cannot see the screen on their computers. Making the website more accessible widens the demographic of people who can utilize the website. It is also a good business move because companies can evade litigations of being exclusive to only able-bodies people. Alt attribute was added to the image tags and the code is more digestible with the added semantic elements and consolidated CSS selectors and profiles. The html file became more logical and concise such as sequential heading order and working navigation links. Overall, the code is able to be accessed by impaired users, so their ultility of the website will not be hindered.
